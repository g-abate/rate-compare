# Product Requirements Document: WordPress Rate Comparison Plugin for Short-Term Rentals

## Introduction/Overview

This feature involves developing a WordPress plugin that enhances direct booking websites for short-term rental properties by providing real-time rate comparison across multiple booking channels (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, etc.). The plugin will dynamically display comparative pricing when users select dates, highlighting the value proposition of booking directly with the property owner/manager.

The primary goal is to increase direct bookings by demonstrating cost savings to potential guests, while providing property managers with a tool to showcase their competitive pricing across all distribution channels.

## Goals

1. **Increase Direct Bookings**: Boost conversion rates on direct booking websites by 15-25% through transparent rate comparison
2. **Enhance User Trust**: Build confidence in direct booking by showing transparent pricing across all channels
3. **Improve User Experience**: Provide seamless, real-time rate comparison without disrupting the existing booking flow
4. **Reduce Channel Dependency**: Help property managers reduce reliance on third-party booking platforms
5. **Universal Compatibility**: Ensure plugin works across various WordPress themes and page builders (Elementor, etc.)

## User Stories

**As a Property Manager/Co-host:**
- I want to configure my property listings from multiple channels (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com) so that I can compare rates across all platforms
- I want to display rate comparisons on my direct booking website so that guests can see the value of booking directly
- I want the comparison to update in real-time so that guests always see current, accurate pricing

**As a Potential Guest:**
- I want to see how much I save by booking directly compared to other channels so that I can make an informed decision
- I want to see the total cost breakdown (including fees) from each channel so that I can compare true costs
- I want the comparison to appear automatically when I select dates so that I don't have to take extra steps

**As a Website Administrator:**
- I want to easily configure the plugin through WordPress admin so that I can set it up without technical expertise
- I want the plugin to work with my existing theme and page builder so that it integrates seamlessly

## Functional Requirements

1. **Channel Configuration Management**
   - The system must allow property managers to input listing URLs from Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com
   - The system must store and manage multiple property listings per channel
   - The system must validate listing URLs and provide error handling for invalid links

2. **Real-Time Rate Fetching**
   - The system must fetch current rates from configured channels when users select dates
   - The system must handle rate fetching for date ranges (check-in to check-out)
   - The system must implement rate caching to improve performance (15-minute cache)
   - The system must gracefully handle API failures or unavailable rates

3. **Rate Comparison Display**
   - The system must display a dynamic popup/modal when users select booking dates
   - The system must show channel logos, prices, and savings calculations
   - The system must highlight when direct booking offers better value
   - The system must display total costs including all fees for accurate comparison

4. **WordPress Integration**
   - The system must work as a standard WordPress plugin with admin configuration panel
   - The system must be compatible with Elementor and other major page builders
   - The system must work across different WordPress themes
   - The system must not conflict with existing booking systems

5. **Data Scraping & API Integration**
   - The system must scrape rates from Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com when APIs are unavailable
   - The system must integrate with OwnerRez API if available for enhanced data accuracy
   - The system must respect robots.txt and implement rate limiting for scraping
   - The system must handle different property listing formats across channels

6. **Performance & Reliability**
   - The system must load comparison data within 3 seconds of date selection
   - The system must implement fallback mechanisms when external data is unavailable
   - The system must not slow down the main website loading time
   - The system must handle high traffic without performance degradation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Booking Integration**: The plugin will not handle actual booking transactions - only rate comparison
2. **Revenue Management**: The plugin will not provide dynamic pricing or revenue optimization features
3. **Multi-language Support**: Initial version will be English-only
4. **Mobile App**: Focus is on WordPress web integration only
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic usage tracking only, no detailed reporting dashboard
6. **Channel Management**: The plugin will not manage listings on external platforms

## Design Considerations

- **UI/UX**: Clean, minimal design that doesn't distract from the booking flow
- **Responsive Design**: Must work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Branding**: Allow customization of colors and styling to match property branding
- **Accessibility**: Follow WordPress accessibility guidelines and WCAG standards
- **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators during rate fetching

## Technical Considerations

- **WordPress Standards**: Follow WordPress coding standards and best practices
- **Security**: Implement proper sanitization and validation for all user inputs
- **Database**: Use WordPress custom tables for storing channel configurations and cached rates
- **Caching**: Implement WordPress transient API for rate caching
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and implement efficient caching strategies

## Success Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate**: Increase in direct booking conversions by 15-25%
2. **User Engagement**: 80% of users who see the comparison tool interact with it
3. **Performance**: Rate comparison loads within 3 seconds for 95% of requests
4. **Reliability**: 99% uptime for rate fetching functionality
5. **Adoption**: Plugin installed on 100+ properties within first 6 months

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting**: What are the optimal caching intervals to balance accuracy and performance?
2. **Legal Compliance**: Are there any legal considerations for scraping booking platforms?
3. **API Costs**: What are the costs associated with OwnerRez API usage?
4. **Channel Expansion**: Which additional booking channels should be prioritized for future versions?
5. **A/B Testing**: Should the plugin include built-in A/B testing capabilities for different display formats?
