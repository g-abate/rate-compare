# Product Requirements Document: Universal Rate Comparison Snippet

## Introduction/Overview

This feature involves developing a universal JavaScript snippet that can be installed on any website to provide real-time rate comparison across multiple booking channels (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, Expedia, etc.). The snippet will be designed for easy integration by non-technical users while providing powerful rate comparison functionality to help property managers increase direct bookings.

The primary goal is to create a simple, universal solution that works across all website platforms (WordPress, Shopify, static HTML, React, etc.) while being easy enough for property managers with basic website knowledge to install and configure.

## Goals

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Work seamlessly on any website platform (WordPress, Shopify, static HTML, React, Vue, etc.)
2. **Easy Installation**: Enable non-technical users to install with minimal setup (copy-paste or simple script tag)
3. **Increase Direct Bookings**: Boost conversion rates by 15-25% through transparent rate comparison
4. **Zero Dependencies**: Work without requiring additional frameworks or libraries
5. **Mobile-First Design**: Provide excellent user experience across all devices
6. **Fast Performance**: Load and display comparisons within 2 seconds

## User Stories

**As a Property Manager (Non-Technical):**
- I want to copy-paste a simple code snippet into my website so that I can add rate comparison without hiring a developer
- I want to configure my property listings through a simple web form so that I don't need to edit code
- I want the snippet to work on my existing website without breaking anything

**As a Property Manager (Basic Technical Knowledge):**
- I want to customize the appearance to match my website's branding so that it looks integrated
- I want to place the comparison widget exactly where I want it on my page
- I want to see clear instructions for installation and configuration

**As a Potential Guest:**
- I want to see rate comparisons automatically when I select dates so that I can make informed decisions
- I want to see the total cost including all fees so that I can compare true prices
- I want the comparison to work smoothly on my mobile device

**As a Website Developer:**
- I want the snippet to be lightweight and not conflict with existing code
- I want clear documentation and examples for integration
- I want the ability to customize the widget's behavior and appearance

## Functional Requirements

1. **Universal Installation**
   - The snippet must work with a single script tag inclusion
   - The snippet must be available via CDN for easy integration
   - The snippet must work without requiring build tools or package managers
   - The snippet must be self-contained with no external dependencies

2. **Simple Configuration System**
   - The system must provide a web-based configuration panel for non-technical users
   - The system must generate a unique configuration token for each property
   - The system must allow configuration updates without code changes
   - The system must validate configuration data and provide clear error messages

3. **Flexible Display Options**
   - The system must support both inline widget and floating button display modes
   - The system must allow positioning via CSS selectors or data attributes
   - The system must provide responsive design that works on all screen sizes
   - The system must include default styling that can be easily overridden

4. **Multi-Channel Rate Fetching**
   - The system must fetch rates from Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, and Expedia
   - The system must implement a hybrid approach: client-side scraping with server-side API fallback
   - The system must handle rate limiting and respect robots.txt policies
   - The system must gracefully handle API failures with appropriate fallback mechanisms

5. **Smart Caching Strategy**
   - The system must implement browser localStorage caching (15-minute TTL)
   - The system must use server-side caching for frequently requested data
   - The system must provide cache invalidation for real-time updates
   - The system must handle cache failures gracefully

6. **Date Selection Integration**
   - The system must automatically detect common date picker libraries and inputs
   - The system must provide manual date selection API for custom implementations
   - The system must support both single-date and date-range selections
   - The system must trigger comparison display when dates are selected

7. **Security & Performance**
   - The system must sanitize all user inputs and configuration data
   - The system must implement CORS and CSP-compliant requests
   - The system must load asynchronously without blocking page rendering
   - The system must be under 50KB gzipped for fast loading

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Booking Integration**: The snippet will not handle actual booking transactions
2. **Revenue Management**: No dynamic pricing or revenue optimization features
3. **Multi-language Support**: Initial version will be English-only
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic usage tracking only, no detailed reporting
5. **Channel Management**: Will not manage listings on external platforms
6. **Custom Backend**: Will use existing infrastructure, not build custom servers

## Design Considerations

- **Installation Flow**: One-click installation with automatic configuration detection
- **Default Styling**: Clean, modern design that works with most website themes
- **CSS Customization**: CSS custom properties for easy theming and branding
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and error states
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with responsive breakpoints

## Technical Considerations

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (graceful degradation)
- **CORS Handling**: Proper cross-origin request handling for all browsers
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient DOM manipulation
- **Browser Support**: Support for all modern browsers (IE11+)

## Success Metrics

1. **Installation Success**: 95% of users successfully install within 5 minutes
2. **Performance**: Rate comparison loads within 2 seconds for 98% of requests
3. **Conversion Rate**: Increase in direct booking conversions by 15-25%
4. **User Engagement**: 85% of users who see the comparison interact with it
5. **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime for rate fetching functionality
6. **Adoption**: 500+ properties using the snippet within first 6 months

## Implementation Approach

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting**: What's the optimal balance between data freshness and API rate limits?
2. **Legal Compliance**: What are the legal considerations for cross-platform rate scraping?
3. **Monetization**: Should this be a freemium service with paid tiers for advanced features?
4. **Data Accuracy**: How can we ensure rate data accuracy across different channels?
5. **Scalability**: What infrastructure is needed to support thousands of concurrent users?
